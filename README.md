## Let's build a web site!

Clone this directory by clicking the 'Clone in Desktop' button to the right.

Included in this repo are the following files:

**Text**
- election.txt
- obama.txt
- romney.txt

**Images**
- electoral-map-2012.png
- barack-obama.jpg
- mitt-romney.jpg


##Here's what you need to do.

**1. Organize the content into separate .html files.**

Set up your HTML files. Each document should be its own web page. Make sure your main page is saved as `index.html`. I've started you off with a basic template. You should also have an `obama.html` and `romney.html` file with the appropriate content included.

**DO NOT** change file names, or move them into a different directory.


**2. Mark up the content**

There are many types of content included in the documents. Text, lists, photos, figures and tabular data. Use semantic tags to organize the information. There's also a hierarchy to the information presented. Think about how would you mark up the information included.

Be sure to discuss with your pair what kind of information is being presented.  Is it text?  Is it a header?  A list?  Ordered or unordered?  A figure?  Would the information work in a table?  Should the text be emphasized?

There may be tags you can use (which we may not have gone over in lecture) which are better suited for presenting the information at hand. Feel free to refer to the [HTML Tags](https://github.com/umiami-web-design/html-tags) repo or the Mozilla [HTML Element Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element).

This step should probably take a while. There is plenty of content to code.


**3. Link the pages**

Once you've marked up each page, link the pages together. At the top of each document is what would constitute a site menu ("Home", "Barack Obama", "Mitt Romney"). Make it so a person could start at any page and get to any other page.  Maybe you want to link other bits of text to pages within your site?


## How to tackle the project

Agree with your pair on a task you want to accomplish. It's okay to work on easy, familiar things first.

Write down the task. When you complete it, check it off. Decide on a new task to tackle.

If you get stuck, it is okay to set the challenge aside and pick a new task. Note the item you struggled with (so you can spend time on it later) and keep moving forward.


## Why isn't X working?

I'm around to help and answer questions, but try working through the problem with your pair first.

Some things to ask yourselves: Are your file names correct? Did you forget to include quotes around attributes? Are there typos in element, attribute, value names? Did you forget to close a tag?

Remember, you can always refer to your notes or any resources made available to you in the [GitHub class repo](https://github.com/umiami-web-design).


**Good luck!**
